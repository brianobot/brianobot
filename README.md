👋 Hi, I'm Brian—a Backend Engineer passionate about Python, Django, Rust, and system architecture. I thrive on building scalable solutions, exploring algo-trading, fintech, and Web3, and crafting innovative software. When I'm not coding, I enjoy chess, sci-fi, quantum physics, and skydiving (one day!). Always eager to learn, build, and share knowledge. Let’s connect! 🚀
